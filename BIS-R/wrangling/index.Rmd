## Before we start...

Data frames (data.frames) are used for storing data tables; it is a list of vectors of equal length (very similar to an Excel sheet). Data frames are the single most used data type in R.  

```{r eval=FALSE}
tax.mp <- data.frame(
    "sex" = c('M', 'M', 'M', 'M', 'F', 'F'),
    "Party" = c('Con', 'Con', 'Lab', 'Con', 'SNP', 'Lab'), 
    "Name" = c('Cameron', 'Osborne', 'Corbyn', 'Johnson', 'Sturgeon', 'Flint'),
    "Income" = c(200307, 198738, 70795 , 612583, 104000, 58724),
    "Tax" = c(75898, 72210, 18912, 276505, 31000, 12965)
    )
```

```{r echo=FALSE}
tax.mp
```

--- .quiz

## Quiz

Take 2 minutes to figure out what do these commands do: 

```{r eval=FALSE}

tax.mp[1,2]

tax.con <- tax.mp$Party == 'Con'

mean(tax.mp$Income[tax.con])

with(tax.mp, sum(Income - Tax))

subset(tax.mp, Party == 'Lab', select = c('Name', 'Income'))

```

<small style="font-size: 50%">Answers on the next slide...</small>


--- .quiz


```{r eval=TRUE}

tax.mp[2,4] # it selects the fourth column in the second row of tax.mp

tax.con <- tax.mp$Party == 'Con'  # this creates a boolean vector where all conservatives are TRUE

mean(tax.mp$Income[tax.con])  # this calculates the mean income of the conservatives

with(tax.mp, sum(Income - Tax))   # this calculates the difference between income and taxes for everyone

subset(tax.mp, Party == 'Lab', select = c('Name', 'Income'))  # this selects the name and income of labour members

```

## Introducing... "The HadleyVerse"

_*TidyR*_: for tidying data frames

* gather()
* spread()
* separate()

*dplyR*: for manipulating data frames

* filter()
* arrange()
* select()
* mutate()

*ReadR*: for reading in data

* read_csv()

---

## The %>% (pipe) operator

In a pipe, the result of the left hand statement is handed over to the statement on the right (much like the UNIX pipe command, e.g. ls -l | grep key | less):

```{r, eval=FALSE}
data %>% function %>% function
```

```{r}
head(iris,2)

iris %>% head(2)
```

--- .intermezzo

## Tidying data

In this section, we are going to learn how to create tidy data frames:
* gather()
* separate()
* spread()


--- .tidy

## What are tidy data?

Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualise, and have a specific structure:

* each variable is a column, 
* each observation is a row, and 
* each type of observational unit is a table

<img src="assets/img/tidy_data.jpg" />

Tidy data provides a standard to move data around between tools. 



---

## What are tidy data?

Let's look at it the other way around - what are examples of messy data?

* Column headers are values, not variable names
* Multiple variables are stored in one column
* Variables are stored in both rows and columns
* Multiple types of observations stored in the same table
* A single observational unit is stored across multiple tables

How can we deal with each of these scenarios? (focus on first 3)

---

## Dealing with messy data

*Column headers are values, not variable names*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
messy <- data.frame(
  A=c('BIS', 'DWP', 'DCLG', 'DFE', 'MOJ'),
  B=sample(1:999, 5, replace=T),
  C=sample(1:999, 5, replace=T),
  D=sample(1:999, 5, replace=T),
  E=sample(1:999, 5, replace=T)
);names(messy) <- c('Department', '<22k','22-32k','32-42k','>42k')

messy
```

Three variables - Department, income and frequency - but 5 columns. To tidy it, we need to **gather** the non-variable columns into a two-column key-value pair. 

You may know this as converting a wide dataset into a long dataset.

---

## Dealing with messy data

*Column headers are values, not variable names*

```{r, eval=FALSE}
gather(data=messy, key=income, value=frequency, -Department)
```
```{r}
messy %>% gather(income, frequency, -Department) %>% head(7)
```

This form is tidy because each column represents a variable and each row represents an observation, in this case a demographic unit corresponding to a combination of department and income.

---

## Dealing with messy data

*Multiple variables stored in one column*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
messy <- data.frame(
  A=c('Birmingham', 'Cambridge', 'Oxford', 'Southampton', 'Bristol'),
  B=sample(500:999, 5, replace=T),
  C=sample(100:300, 5, replace=T),
  D=sample(400:999, 5, replace=T),
  E=sample(100:300, 5, replace=T)
);

names(messy) <- c('University', 'M18-25','M25-35','F18-25','F25-35')

messy
```

Four variables: University, Sex, Age range and frequency.

To tidy it, we need to first **gather** the non-variable columns into key - value pairs, then **seperate** the key (e.g. M18-25) into two variables.

---

## Dealing with messy data
*Multiple variables stored in one column (cont.)*

```{r}
messy %>% gather(key, value, -University) %>% head(10)
```

---

## Dealing with messy data
*Multiple variables stored in one column (cont.)*

```{r}
messy %>% gather(key, value, -University) %>% separate(key, c('Sex','Age'), 1) %>% head(12)
```

---

## Dealing with messy data
*Variables are stored in both rows and columns*

```{r, echo=FALSE}
n <- 6
messy <- data.frame(
  year=rep(2016, n), 
  month=rep(1:3,2), 
  range=rep(c('Min', 'Max'), each=3), 
  d1=sample(500:999, n, replace=T), 
  d2=sample(500:999, n, replace=T), 
  d3=sample(500:999, n, replace=T), 
  d4=sample(500:999, n, replace=T), 
  d5=sample(500:999, n, replace=T), 
  d6=sample(500:999, n, replace=T), 
  d7=sample(500:999, n, replace=T)
)

messy
```

This data set has variables in individual columns (id, year, month) and across columns (weekday) but also across rows (range). 

---

## Dealing with messy data
*Variables are stored in both rows and columns (cont.)*

To tidy this, we first gather the weekday columns: 

```{r}
messy %>% 
  gather(day, value, d1:d7) %>% 
  head(8)
```

Mostly tidy, but range is still not a variable (it stores names of variables).

---

## Dealing with messy data
*Variables are stored in both rows and columns (cont.)*

Fixing this requires the spread function: 

```{r}
messy %>% 
  gather(day, value, d1:d7) %>% 
  spread(range, value) %>% 
  head(8)
```

--- .quiz

## Quiz

Consider these two data sets: which is the tidy data set?

```{r echo=FALSE}
data <- data.frame(
  id=1:4,
  x=rnorm(4, mean=6, sd=3), 
  y=rnorm(4, mean=2, sd=2)
)

data

data %>% gather(variable, value, -id)

```

--- .quiz

## Quiz

Consider these data:

```{r}
stocks %>% head(5)
```

What does this command do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
stocks %>% gather(key, value, -time) %>% spread(key, value) %>% head(5)
```



--- .intermezzo

## Data manipulation

In this section, we are going to learn how to manipulate data frames using "Split - Apply - Combine" types of analyses, e.g.:

* filter() and select()
* arrange()
* mutate() and transmute()
* summarise()

---

## Let's load some data

```{r eval=FALSE}

# install the package - all flights departing from NYC in 2013
install.packages('nycflights13')

# load the packages
library(nycflights13)
library(dplyr)

# we can now use the 'flights' data.frame as normal:
summary(flights)

# convert to a 'tibble' -  A tbl is just a special kind of data.frame. They make your data easier to look at, but 
# also easier to work with; a tbl is straightforwardly derived from a data.frame structure using tbl_df().

# The tbl format changes how R displays your data, but it does not change the data's underlying data structure. A
# tbl inherits the original class of its input, in this case, a data.frame. This means that you can still 
# manipulate the tbl as if it were a data.frame; you can do anything with the flights tbl that you could do with 
# the flights data.frame.
flights <- tbl_df(flights)

# let's have a better look at it
glimpse(flights)
```

---

```{r}
# let's have a better look at it
glimpse(flights)

```

---

## select()

The select() function is the same as the base subset() function, but also allows fancy use of helper functions like starts_with(), ends_with(), matches() and contains():

What might the following R commands do?

```{r, eval=F}

select(flights, month)

flights %>% select(month)

flights %>% select(-day)

flights %>% select(1:3)

flights %>% select(flight:dest)

```

More examples on the next couple of slides...

---

## select()

Select all columns to do with delays:

```{r}
flights %>% select(ends_with('delay'))
```

---

## select()

Select all columns to do with arrivals:

```{r}
flights %>% select(contains('arr'))
```

---

## filter()

Filter allows you to subset by rows. It will take any logical statement (something that will produce TRUE and FALSE values, e.g. a boolean vector):

What might the following R commands do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}

# single criterion
filter(flights, origin == 'JFK')
flights %>% filter(dep_delay < 10)
flights %>% filter(carrier %in% c('UA', 'DL', 'AA'))

# Multiple criteria
flights %>% filter(dep_delay < 10 & arr_delay > 10)
flights %>% filter(dep_delay < 10 | arr_delay > 10)

# Multiple arguments are equivalent to and
flights %>% filter(dep_delay < 10, arr_delay == 1)


```

---

## arrange()

The arrange() function lets you order the rows by one or more columns in ascending or descending order:

What might the following R commands do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}

arrange(flights, dep_time)

flights %>% arrange(dep_delay)

flights %>% arrange(dep_delay, arr_delay)

flights %>% arrange(desc(dep_delay))

```

---

## mutate()

In contrast to select(), which retains a subset of all variables, mutate() creates new columns which are added to a copy of the dataset.

What might the following R commands do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}

flights$total_delay <- flights$dep_delay + flights$arr_delay

mutate(flights, total_delay2 = dep_delay + arr_delay)

flights %>% mutate(total_delay = dep_delay + arr_delay)

flights %>% mutate(date = paste(year, month, day, sep='-'))

```

Which of these will change (i.e. add a column to) the object called flights?

---

## summarise() or summarize()

Summarises multiple values into a single value

What might the following R commands do?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# our data has NULL (NA) values, so we need to tell R to remove those
with(flights, mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T))

# in dplyr
summarise(flights, mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T))

flights %>% summarise(mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T))

summarise(group_by(flights, carrier), mean(dep_delay, na.rm=T))

```

---

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>% 
  summarise(avg_delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  arrange(avg_delay)
```

---

## And finally... ReadR

Let's read in some election data. I will use this in a future session.

```{r eval=FALSE}
# if you haven't already done so, install the package
install.packages('readr')
```

```{r}
# load the library
library(readr)

# load the file
election.results <- read_csv('./assets/election_results_2015.csv')

# how big?
dim(election.results)

```
I challenge thee to <a href='assets/election_results_2015.csv'>download the data</a> and think about how you might tidy these data using tidyr and produce meaningful data using dplyr. 

---

## Some examples

*How many people voted?*

```{r}
election.results %>% 
  filter(Country=='England')%>% 
  rename(nvotes = `Total number of valid votes counted`) %>%
  summarise(total=sum(nvotes)/sum(Electorate))
  
```

---

## Some examples

*In which constituency was the pirate party most popular?*

```{r}
election.results %>% 
  arrange(desc(Pirate)) %>%
  select(`Constituency Name`, Region, Pirate) %>%
  head(3)
```

---

## Some examples

*Other possible questions:*

* Who would have won if there was proportional representation?
* What was the share of votes of the BNP in England and Scotland?

What questions would you want to answer from these data?

## The road ahead

*There will be more sessions*

* In the next session (Wed 25 May) we will look at visualising our data in R. We'll learn some basic plotting, but also how to use a plotting library called ggplot2. 

* In the session after that (likely Wed 8th of June) we'll look at a case study that combines all the skills we have picked up up to that point. 

*Wrapping up:*

* Don't forget to leave me feedback: http://goo.gl/forms/yvYPJ7OEP5

* Slides are on <a href="http://cbas/lugtigha">http://cbas/lugtigha</a>
